    <h1>Hello My Name Is Shumaila</h1>
    <p>I am a second year student at Noroff-School of Technology and Digital Media</p>
    <p>Im 29 years old and are currently living in Bergen, Norway.
        I was born and raised in Sweden but i moved to Norway 3 years ago. 
        Im married and a mother of 3 beautiful kids.
    </p>
    <p> In 2017 I started a self-employed company in the beauty branch, but due to some allergic reactions to the metarial i had to quit.
        I had interesst in technology and always wanted to explore this field but i did not dare because i didnt know if i was smart enough!
    But finally in 2020 i thought "when there is a will, there are many ways", and if i work hard enough i surely wil make it through!
And by so far my experience have been amazing. i've learned tremendous of knowledge but i have a logn way to go. </p>
<p>like i mentioned above, im a mother as well. i love to spend time with my family and besides my studies my family are my priority.
    i love to cook food and wierd as it sounds, i love to clean also.
when i have free time just for my slef i like to read novels or do crash courses on scrimba regarding front end developing.  </p>
