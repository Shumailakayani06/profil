            <h1 class="intro-h1">Hello My Name Is Shumaila,</h1>
            <p>I am a second year student at Noroff-School of Technology and Digital Media.</p>
            <p>I'm 29 years old and currently living in Bergen, Norway.
                I was born and brought up in Sweden but i moved to Norway 3 years ago.
                I'm married and mother to 3 beautiful children.
            </p>
            <p> In 2017 I started a self-employed company in the beauty branch, but due to some allergic reactions i had
                to quit.
                I had interest in technology and always wanted to explore this field but i didn't dare because i didn't
                knew if i could do it or not!
                But finally in 2020 i thought "when there is a will, there are many ways", and if i work hard enough i
                will surely make it through!
                And by so far my experiences have been amazing. I've learned tremendous amount of knowledge but i have a
                long way to go. </p>
            <p>Like i mentioned above, I'm a mother as well. I love to spend time with my family.
                I love to cook food and as wierd as it sounds, i love to clean also.
                In my spare time, I spend alot of time doing various crash courses online or read novels.
            </p>
